        "Face detection models, while powerful, can be sensitive to various factors. If the system reported 'No face found' even when you believe your face was clearly visible, here are some common reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Poor Lighting:** Insufficient or harsh lighting can obscure facial features.\n",
        "*   **Angles and Pose:** Extreme angles, looking significantly away from the camera, or having part of your face covered can hinder detection.\n",
        "*   **Obstructions:** Hair, glasses (especially reflective ones), hats, masks, or hands covering parts of the face can make detection difficult.\n",
        "*   **Image Resolution and Quality:** Low-resolution images, blurry photos, or highly compressed images may lack the detail needed for accurate detection.\n",
        "*   **Distance from Camera:** Being too far or too close to the camera can affect how clearly facial features are captured.\n",
        "*   **Background Clutter:** A busy or complex background might confuse the detection algorithm, making it harder to isolate the face.\n",
        "\n",
        "To improve detection, please ensure your selfie:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Has good, even lighting.**\n",
